Übersetzen mittels \lstinline[language=Bash]$gcc -O2 ue41.c -o ue41 -fopenmp -Wall -Wextra -std=c99$

Auf einem 8-core Xeon E5410 mit 6GB RAM getestet mit dem ergebnis
(Median von 5 Durchläufen, N=Arraygröße, P=anzahl threads):

\subsection*{1.}

Standardmäßig werden 8 threads benutzt (=anzahl PEs)

\subsection*{2.}

\begin{table}[htp]
	\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{l|cccc}

		\backslashbox{N}{P}	&	1	&	2	&	4	&	8	\\

Für N=1000 und N=1000000 ist der Overhead zu groß, so dass es zu einem slowdown statt einem speedup kommt. Bei N=100000000 lässt sich ein erster (geringer) speedup beobachten. Größere Arraywerte führten zu einem Out of memory error (getestet mit N=1000000000).

\section*{Aufgabe 4.2}

Übersetzen mittels \lstinline[language=Bash]$gcc -O2 phil_deadlock.c -o deadlock -Wall -Wextra -std=c99 -lpthread$

Ein Ablaufprotokoll findet sich in \autoref{sec:results2}

\lstinputlisting{phil_deadlock.c}

Zum Deadlock kann es kommen, wenn alle Philosophen gleichzeitig die linke Gabel aufheben. Sie warten in diesem Fall dann alle unendlich darauf die rechte Gabel aufheben zu könne, welche bereits von ihrem Nachbarn verwendet wird.

Das Problem lässt sich durch eine \glqq Ganz oder gar nicht \grqq Strategie lösen. Jeder Philosph hebt die linke Gabel normal auf. Kann er anschließend die rechte Gabel nicht sofort aufheben, so legt er die linke Gabel wieder zurück und denkt weiter.

Diese Lösung ist nicht fair und kann zu Starvation bei einzelnen Philosophen führen. Deadlocks können aber nicht auftreten.

Übersetzen mittels \lstinline[language=Bash]$gcc -O2 phil_no_deadlock.c -o no_deadlock -Wall -Wextra -std=c99 -lpthread$

\section*{Aufgabe 4.3}

Vorteile von Dragon gegenüber MESI:

\begin{itemize}
	\item kürzere Zugriffszeit (führt im Gegensatz zu MESi nicht zu Cache-misses)
	\item spart Bandbreite (nach Möglichkeit werden kleinere Abschnitte
geschrieben als Block)
\end{itemize}

Nachteile von Dragon gegenüber MESI:

\begin{itemize}
	\item konsekutive Schreiboperationen eines PEs erzeugen mehere
Update-Transaktionen
\end{itemize}
